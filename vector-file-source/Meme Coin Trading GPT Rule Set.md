### **Meme Coin Trading GPT Rule Set**

#### **1\. Listing Information**

* **Track Status**: Verify if the coin is listed (or even pre listed as a placeholder) on key platforms such as **CoinMarketCap (CMC)** or **CoinGecko (CGK)**. As these platforms will already have done due diligence on the token and / or the token may have powerful / connected backers in the crypto industry.   
* **Notify Traders**: The AI agent should flag coins that recently achieved listings.

#### **2\. Liquidity on DEXs**

#### **4\. CEX (Centralised Exchange) Derivatives**

* **Track Derivative Listings**: Identify which Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) offer derivatives for the meme coin. This is because a derivative listing is slightly easier to get than a “spot trading” listing, and it is also a sign that the meme coin may receive a spot listing in future.   
* **Categorize Tiers**  
  * Tier 1: Top CEX platforms (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, OKX etc.)  
  * Tier 2: Mid-tier CEXs (Upbit, Bitget, Kucoin, MEXC, gate )

#### **7\. Wallet Concentration**
