# AI Agent MVP Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview
The AI Agent MVP will:
- Evaluate crypto tokens using vector database knowledge, real-time market data, and sentiment analysis.
- Provide actionable insights and analytics to users through a chat-based interface.
- Fetch feedback for continuous learning with admin approval.
- Periodically monitor market trends and notify users of significant updates.

This document outlines the modular architecture and development steps for the MVP.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 User Query Preprocessing
**Objective**: Normalize and validate user inputs.
- **Functionality**:
  - Filter spam or malicious content.
  - Normalize user text (e.g., lowercase, punctuation removal).
- **Implementation**: Use Python string manipulation or `nltk`.

---

### 2.2 Query Transformation
**Objective**: Convert user-friendly queries into structured formats.
- **Functionality**:
  - Transform inputs into JSON for agent processing.
  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "action": "analyze",
      "entity": "Bitcoin",
      "metrics": ["price", "volume"]
    }
    ```
- **Implementation**:
  - Use LangChain **PromptTemplate** to structure inputs.
  - Include session information (user ID, session state).

---

### 2.3 Query Routing
**Objective**: Direct queries to the appropriate tools and modules.
- **Functionality**:
  - Route queries to external APIs, vector database, or sentiment analysis module.
  - Use LangChain’s **ConversationalReActAgent**.
- **Tools**:
  - **Real-time Market Data Tool**: Fetch data from APIs like CoinGecko.
  - **Sentiment Analysis Tool**: Analyze social media sentiment.
  - **Vector DB Retriever Tool**: Retrieve data from Pinecone.

---

### 2.4 Real-Time Data Retrieval
**Objective**: Gather market and sentiment data dynamically.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Market Data**: Use APIs to fetch trading volume, price, and market cap.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Use APIs for platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
- **Integration**: Wrap Python scripts as LangChain Tools.

---

### 2.5 Vector Database Integration
**Objective**: Retrieve and embed data for evaluation.
- **Database**: Pinecone.
- **Embedding Generator**: OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002`.
- **Workflow**:
  - Embed proprietary evaluation logic.
  - Retrieve relevant data during agent queries.

---

### 2.6 Evaluation Module
**Objective**: Combine retrieved data for actionable insights.
- **Functionality**:
  - Use OpenAI GPT API for text-based analysis and recommendations.
  - Combine data from APIs, vector DB, and sentiment analysis.
- **Example**:
  - Input: Market trends, token data, and sentiment.
  - Output: "Bitcoin shows bullish trends with a 10% rise in volume over the past week."

---

### 2.7 Feedback and Learning Modules
**Objective**: Store user feedback and improve the system.
- **Functionality**:
  - Collect feedback via user interactions.
  - Suggest updates to the proprietary database.
  - Admin approval for DB updates.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store feedback in a Django database.
  - Use admin panel for review.

---

### 2.8 Periodic Market Monitoring
**Objective**: Monitor and evaluate market data regularly.
- **Functionality**:
  - Fetch data every hour.
  - Use evaluation logic to analyze trends.
  - Notify users of significant updates.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Celery for scheduling tasks in Django.

---

### 2.9 Context Management
**Objective**: Maintain short-term and long-term memory for user interactions.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Short-Term Memory**: Use LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory.
  - **Long-Term Memory**: Store session data in PostgreSQL.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate memory into LangChain’s agent workflow.

---

### 2.10 Admin Panel
**Objective**: Provide admin control over agent behavior and data.
- **Functionality**:
  - Review and approve feedback.
  - Manage periodic monitoring schedules.
  - Configure agent rules and logic.
- **Implementation**: Use Django Admin.

---

## 3. Development Steps
1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Install Django and LangChain.
   - Set up REST APIs for frontend integration.
2. **Vector Database**:
   - Configure Pinecone for embeddings.
   - Embed proprietary data using OpenAI.
3. **Agent Configuration**:
   - Initialize LangChain’s ConversationalReActAgent.
   - Add tools for market data, sentiment analysis, and vector retrieval.
4. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Connect chat-based interface to the backend API.
   - Ensure compatibility with both short-term and long-term memory.
5. **Admin Interface**:
   - Build Django Admin for feedback approval and monitoring settings.
6. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit and integration tests for all modules.
   - Validate data flow between user input, tools, and agent responses.

---

## 4. Future Enhancements
1. **Custom User Agents**:
   - Allow users to define and deploy personalized agents.
2. **Advanced Learning**:
   - Implement rule-based logic alongside LLMs.
   - Enable self-learning for agents to adapt without admin intervention.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Add configurable monitoring intervals and more advanced triggers.
4. **Feedback Automation**:
   - Reduce reliance on admin approval for non-critical updates.

---

## 5. Tools and Libraries
- **Django**: Backend framework.
- **LangChain**: Agent orchestration and tool integration.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for RAG.
- **OpenAI**: LLM and embeddings.
- **Celery**: Task scheduling for periodic monitoring.

---

## 6. Modular Architecture
All components are designed to be modular and reusable across other projects:
- Each module (e.g., preprocessing, query routing, vector DB) can operate independently.
- Clear interfaces between modules ensure ease of testing and future scalability.
